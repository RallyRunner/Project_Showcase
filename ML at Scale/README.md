# Machine Learning at Scale
The final project of my MIDS DATASCI261 - Machine Learning at Scale class. 
The project's objective was to employ various distributed machine learning techniques to predict flight delay on big data.
Distributed algorithms such as linear regression, random forest, and XGboost were ran via PySpark's MLLib.
Neural network regression was also attempted as a proof of concept.
