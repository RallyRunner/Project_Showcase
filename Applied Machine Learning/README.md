# Applied Machine Learning
The final project of my MIDS DATASCI207 - Applied Machine Learning class. The project's objective was to employ various data analysis and machine learning techniques to predict genres for tracks, using audio characteristics. ML techniques and algorithms included building a baseline model, KNN, K-means, decision trees, and neural network models.
