# MIDS Data Science Portfolio
Collective repository of personal &amp; collaborative projects I've done during the MIDS program at UC Berkeley & during my undergraduate studies at Northeastern University.

# Projects
### Applied Machine Learning
"Spotify Genre Prediction" final project which explores various models to predict a song's genre based on audio characteristics.

### Computer Vision
"Mars Terrain Classification" final project which explores building models for image classification based on an image's various features such as HOG, SIFT Bag of Visual Words, and feature embeddings from a pre-trained neural network.

### Data Engineering
"AGM NoSQL Business Case Scenarios" final project to apply data engineering concepts and pipelines using Docker, Neo4j, Redis, MongoDB, SQL, etc. to help enhance customer experience for a food delivery company.

### Database Design Project
Designed and implemented a database using PostgreSQL to fit the needs of a car rental company.

### EvoTA
Programming project using object-oriented programming and evolutionary computing algorithms to help professors solve their teaching assistant allocation issues.

### ML at Scale
"Flight Delay Prediction" final project to apply distributed machine learning libraries such as PySpark and MLLib using flight data from 2015 to 2019.

### Natural Language Processing
"Abstracting Terms of Service Documents" final project to train and fine-tune large language models such as BERT, T5, and GPT to classify important highlights and paraphrase them from a ToS document.

### Statistics
Projects related to statistical concepts using R.  

### Research Design
A research design proposal to propose a study on bird collisions due to light pollution.
