# Evolutionary Computing
I created an app to help assign teaching assistant (TA) to class sections based on the TA's preferred schedule. The app uses evolutionary computing algorithms to generate, iterate, and optimize solutions.

# Content
1. Application - Code used to run the application on streamlit
2. Assignments - Code that includes the agents to optimize the solution
3. Evo - Code that contains the Evo class to run the agents and optimize the solution
