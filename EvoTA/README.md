# Evolutionary Computing
I created an app to help assign teaching assistants (TA) to class sections based on the TA's preferred schedule. The app uses evolutionary computing algorithms to generate, iterate, and optimize solutions.
The app can be used here: https://taassigner.streamlit.app/

# Content
1. Application - Code used to run the application on streamlit
2. Assignments - Code that includes the agents to optimize the solution
3. Evo - Code that contains the Evo class to run the agents and optimize the solution
