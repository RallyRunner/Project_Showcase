# Computer Vision
The final project of my MIDS DATASCI281 - Computer Vision class.
The objective of our final project was to utilize various computer vision feature extraction methods to classify Mars Terrain imagery captured by NASA's satellite imagery.
Final features included HOG, SIFT Bag of Visual Words, and feature embeddings from Resnet50. 
Using a voting classifier that included a SVM, Logistic Regression, and a Histogram-based Gradient Boosting model, we achieved a final test accuracy of 87%.
