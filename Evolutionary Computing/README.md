# TA Assignment App
I created an app to assign teacher assistants (TA) to sections of classes based on the schedule preferences of the TA's. The app uses evolutionary computing algorithms to generate, iterate, and update an optimized solution for the problem.
# Contents
1. Application - Code for the app to run on Streamlit
2. Assignments - Code containing agents to run for optimizing the solution
3. Evo - Code containing the evo class to run the agents against the problem and produce a dominant solution
